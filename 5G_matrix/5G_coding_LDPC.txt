** LDPC max block size is 8448bits

** code rates are: 1/5 1/3 2/5 1/2 2/3 3/4 5/6 8/9

** there are two LDPC base graphs, the second one is used with lower sizes ( max 3840 bits ) and lower code rates ( 0.67 )

(You can find both base graphs in attachment)

** both base graphs have 8 different Set Indexes (iLS)

** both base graphs have a fixed number of Kb columns to be used for information bits:
Kb = 22 for base graph 1
Kb = 10,9,8,6 for base graph 2 and B > 640,560,192

** The "H matrix" is generated starting from Hbg (base graph), a 46x68 matrix for base graph 1 and 42x52 matrix for base graph 2.
The matrix H is obtained by replacing each element of Hbg with a Zc x Zc matrix, according to the following:
- Each element of value 0 in Hbg is replaced by an all zero matrix 0 of size Zc x Zc ;
- Each element of value 1 in Hbg is replaced by a circular permutation matrix I(Pij) of size Zc x Zc , where i and j are the row and column indices of the element, and I(Pij) is obtained by circularly shifting the identity matrix I of size Zc x Zc to the right Pij times. The value of Pij is given by Pij = mod(Vij , Zc). The value of Vij is given in the specs by Tables 5.3.2-2 and 5.3.2-3 according to the set index i LS and base graph. In the attached base graphs you can find them in a simplified couple of excel tables.

- Zc value is chosen finding the minimum value of Z in all sets of lifting sizes in following Table such that Kb x Zc >= K+
(K+ is the chosen block size)

   Set index (iLS)	   Set of lifting sizes Z
	1		{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256}
	2		{3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384}
	3		{5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320}
	4		{7, 14, 28, 56, 112, 224}
	5		{9, 18, 36, 72, 144, 288}
	6		{11, 22, 44, 88, 176, 352}
	7		{13, 26, 52, 104, 208}
	8		{15, 30, 60, 120, 240}


** The first 2*Zc bits are always "punctured" => removed before sending them (they will be zeroes when decoding)


INFO:

1) A sub-base matrix of corresponding number of rows and columns is extracted from the uniform base matrix to support different code rates in the range.

Example:
BaseGraph 1 

code rate	BG1 rows x cols		BG2 rows x cols

 1/5		not used		42x52
 2/3		13x35			7x17
 1/2		24x46			12x22
 2/5		35x57			17x27
 1/3		46x68			22x32
 3/4		10x32			not used
 8/9		5x27			not used


2) base matrix 1 is quasi-row orthogonal from row 5 to 19 (consecutive rows are orthogonal, with exception of first 2 columns) and row ortoghonal from row 20 to 45.

This choice has been done to simplify the FPGA decoding architecture, I don't know if you can take advantage of it
